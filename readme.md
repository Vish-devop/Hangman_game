Steps to create the hangman game:-

Step-1:
1. Randomly Choose a word from the word_list and assign it to a variable called choosen_word.
2. Ask the user to guess a letter and store the guessed character into a variable.
3. Now, create a list named display, and print the list which consists of "_" of the size of the choosen_word.
4. Replace "_" with the guessed character, and change the position that's present in the choosen_word.
5. Now, create a variable called lives.
